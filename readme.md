Project Description
This project appears to be an image processing application using OpenCV and Python. It includes various image manipulation scripts and outputs such as resized, blurred, edged, and thresholded images.
Files

main.py: Main script for image processing.
camera-test.py: Script for camera-related testing.
output.mp4: Video output file.
cropped.jpg, gray.jpg, hsv.jpg, main.jpg, resized.jpg, resume.png, hari_3_blur.jpg, edges.jpg, image.jpg, main.png, threshold.jpg, pic.jpg: Processed image files.
.gitignore: File to exclude certain files from version control.
venv/: Virtual environment directory.

Setup

Ensure Python and OpenCV are installed.
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Activate the virtual environment: source venv/bin/activate (Linux/Mac) or venv\Scripts\activate (Windows).
Install dependencies if any (e.g., pip install opencv-python).

Usage
Run main.py to process images. Modify the script to adjust image processing parameters as needed.
Notes

The project seems to encounter an assertion error related to image resizing. Check the resize function in main.py (line 5) for debugging.
Ensure all image files are available in the project directory.
